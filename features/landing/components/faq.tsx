      question: 'How accurate are the performance scores?',
      answer:
        "We use our own proprietary engine that combines Chromium's Lighthouse metrics with real-world network data from our 24 global edge nodes. This gives you a score that accurately reflects what real users experience in different parts of the world.",
    },
    {
      question: 'Can I automate scans for my CI/CD pipeline?',
      answer:
        'Yes! Professional and Enterprise plans include access to our robust REST API, allowing you to trigger scans automatically after every deployment to ensure no performance regressions reach production.',
    },
    {
      question: "What exactly do you check in a 'Security Header Audit'?",
      answer:
        "We analyze your server responses for critical security headers including Content-Security-Policy (CSP), HTTP Strict-Transport-Security (HSTS), X-Frame-Options, X-Content-Type-Options, and more. We don't just check for their presence; we evaluate the strength of their configuration.",
    },
    {
      question: 'Is there a limit on how many domains I can scan?',
      answer:
        'Starter accounts can scan any domain but are limited to 3 scans per day. Professional and Enterprise accounts have unlimited scanning across as many domains and subdomains as you need.',
    },
    {
      question: 'Do you offer white-label reports?',
      answer:
        'Enterprise customers can generate fully white-labeled PDF and HTML reports with their own branding, perfect for agencies delivering audit results to their clients.',
    },
